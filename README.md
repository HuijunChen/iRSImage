# iRSImage
This program creates a remote sensing image processing platform with MFC and GDAL libraries. This platform can display the multi-band Landsat RS images, and can process the RS images using Mahalanobis classifier, KL transform, K-means and ISODATA methods implemented myself. More detailed description of this work can be found in the course reports submitted along with the code. The codes of the algorithms are included in the course reports, in case you found it inconvenient to open this VC++6.0 project.
